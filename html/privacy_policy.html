      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> <br>
      <h4><i>Last modified on September 3, 2021</i></h4> <br>

      <p>
        This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") of the AnimalTrack App, and Android App, and describes how AnimalTrack ("AnimalTrack," "We," "Us" or "Our") manages Personal Information (as defined below) that users ("You," "Your” or "User") provide to Us, or that and through the AnimalTrack iOS App, and the AnimalTrack Android App.

        <h3>Your Consent</h3>
        You should read this entire Privacy Policy before submitting information to Us. Whenever You submit personal and non-personal information via to Us, whether online or offline, You consent to the collection, use disclosure, transfer, and storage of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Types of Information We Collect "Personal Information" means information such as Your first/middle initial or name, last name, e-mail address, street address, mailing address if different, town or city, state, zip code, profile photograph, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and any other information that could allow someone to identify You or contact You, including information collected through cookies and other technology. AnimalTrack collects Personal Information of the sort that web browsers, hardware, software, and servers typically make available, such as the IP address, device ID, browser type, language preference, referring site, pages viewed, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, and the date and time of each visitor request. AnimalTrack's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how AnimalTrack's visitors use of the AnimalTrack App. From time to time, AnimalTrack may release such information by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Apps.

        <h3>How We Collect Personal Information</h3>
        AnimalTrack may collect Personal Information when You choose to interact with AnimalTrack in ways that require AnimalTrack to gather such information, such as if You register as an AnimalTrack User, update or add information to Your AnimalTrack profile, provide content to AnimalTrack through Your phone, make a donation to AnimalTrack through the Websites, or otherwise communicate or engage with Us about the AnimalTrack Services. When You post an Observation on AnimalTrack, We may collect Your User ID, latitude and longitude of the site of the Observation, the place name of the site of the Observation, the date and time of the Observation, the metadata associated with the image, the app You used to contribute data, and the time zone of the site of the Observation. The amount and type of information that AnimalTrack gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, AnimalTrack collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of Your interaction with AnimalTrack. AnimalTrack does not disclose Personal Information other than as described herein. You can refuse to supply Personal Information, with the caveat that doing so may prevent You from engaging in certain Website and App-related activities, such as registering as an AnimalTrack User, maintaining an AnimalTrack profile, or posting content to AnimalTrack. Without providing personal information (other than the automatic provision of Your IP address), You will still be able to access and use AnimalTrack on a read-only basis.

        <h3>How We Use Personal Information</h3>
        We may use the Personal Information that You provide in order to deliver the AnimalTrack Services, respond to Your inquiries, improve our services, business, manage our business including spam detection and fraud prevention purposes, for marketing, legal and research purposes, and to understand how You use Our services. If You register as an AnimalTrack User, You must give Us current, complete, and accurate information and keep the information You provide to Us up to date. We cannot and shall not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if You do not give Us current, accurate, truthful, or complete information or if You fail to update the information You give Us.
        
        <h3>When We Disclose and Share Personal Information</h3>
        Personal Information You provide related to the Observations You post (username, date, time, location) is published in venues on AnimalTrack where it is visible to anyone ("Published") as matter of normal usage and therefore is publicly shared with other AnimalTrack Users, whether or not they are signed in. We also explicitly and publicly share this information publicly in a machine-readable or human readable format with others. We may use your location information that you provide through our apps to add thumbnails on where your observations are taken and to separate different area observations. We share Personal Information associated with Users’ registration and account (IP address, email address, etc.). AnimalTrack discloses Personal Information to contractors, service providers, consultants, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on AnimalTrack's behalf or to provide Services available at AnimalTrack's Websites and Apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others, with the exception of non-public location data from Observations for non-commercial research, conservation, and species management purposes. Some of those contractors, service providers and affiliated organizations may be located outside of Your home country; by using the AnimalTrack App, You consent to the transfer of such information to them. AnimalTrack will not rent or sell Personal Information to anyone, except for animal/insect/plant/environment organizations that we give information to such as the upload species, photo image, time, and location. We share your Personal information with entities that support Our business and operations such as hosting and data, communicating with You, fraud and spam detection, data analytics, and other legitimate business purposes including communicating with the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Other than as described above, AnimalTrack discloses Personal Information only when required to do so by law, or when AnimalTrack believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of AnimalTrack, third parties, or the public at large. Unless authorized by You through Your opt-in, or as provided above, We will make Your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties only in the following circumstances: o If We are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court, or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); o If We believe Your actions violate a law, regulation, this Privacy Policy, or any applicable website or app's terms of use, or if You threaten the rights, property or safety of Us, Our Websites, Our Apps, any other Users, or third party; o If, in Our sole discretion, We believe disclosure is necessary to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect Our assets, to defend Our interests or comply with Our legal and regulatory obligations; or to protect a User's safety; o If there is a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving AnimalTrack, the Academy or National Geographic. If You are a registered User of AnimalTrack and have supplied Your email address, AnimalTrack may occasionally send You an email to tell You about new features, solicit Your feedback, or just keep You up to date with what's going on with AnimalTrack and Our services. We primarily use blogs and groups to communicate this type of information, so We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If You send Us a request (for example via a support email or via one of Our feedback mechanisms), We reserve the right to publish it in order to help Us clarify or respond to Your request or to help Us support other Users. AnimalTrack takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of Personal Information.

        <h3>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
        In addition, We process Personal Information with the principle of data minimization in mind. This means that We limit ourselves to the minimum amount of personal information which is needed to achieve the particular purpose for which We process the Personal Information. Below are some examples of the purposes for which Personal Information may be processed. AnimalTrack may process Your Personal Information because: o The processing is necessary to provide the services and features You have requested o The processing is necessary to perform a contract with You o The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of Our business, such as fraud prevention, information security, or to comply with the law o You have provided consent for Us to do so.

        <h3>How We Retain Personal Information</h3>
        We retain Your Personal Information associated with Your registration for so long as You remain a registered User of AnimalTrack. In addition, We may retain Personal Information from closed accounts to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce Our User Agreement and take other actions permitted or required by applicable national laws. Personal information associated with Observations (time, date, location, etc.) may remain attached to Observations, even after You have closed Your account unless You request that We delete it.

        <h3>Children</h3>
        Visitors 12 years of age and younger must obtain an adult's permission before submitting any Personal Information to our Apps.

        <h3>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
        We are committed to protecting the Personal Information You share with Us through the use of AnimalTrack and We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect Your Personal Information. We limit access to Personal Information by Our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating Our standards of security and confidentiality is subject to Our disciplinary processes. We request Our service providers to follow the same policy. Unfortunately, We cannot guarantee that data transmitted over the Internet will always be secure. As a result, although We strive to protect Your Personal Information, We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information You transmit or We may learn as a result of Your use of AnimalTrack and You do so at Your own risk. If, for any reason, You do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use or attempt to take advantage of any of the information, services, features or functions of AnimalTrack that might require You to provide Your Personal Information.

        <h3>Posting Observations</h3>
        If You do not wish to have the time, date, place, or other identifying information of an Observation included on AnimalTrack, You should not post an Observation.

        <h3>Withdraw Consent</h3>
        If You withdraw Your consent for the use or disclosure of Your Personal Information for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy You may not have access to all Our Services and We might not be able to provide You all of the Services and customer support offered to Our users and authorized under this Privacy.

        <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, AnimalTrack may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at AnimalTrack's sole discretion. We will post an updated and revised version of this Privacy Policy on the AnimalTrack Websites when any material changes have been made, and AnimalTrack encourages visitors to check this Privacy Policy often so You are aware of the most current terms and conditions that apply to You. The revisions are effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute Your acceptance of such change.

        <h3>Do Not Track Notice</h3>
        Because there are not yet common, industry accepted “do not track” standards and systems, the Websites may not respond to Do Not Track signals. In addition, we may allow third parties to collect Personal Information from your activity on our website, as described in this Privacy Policy.

        <h3>All Users</h3>
        If any User of Our Apps, or any Subscriber has any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the email managing address, animaltracksendemail@gmail.com.
