      <p>
        We believe that it is everyone's responsibility to care for the Earth, 
        raise public awareness, and help make the planet sustainable. We did this 
        by allowing us to notice whenever a species of animals/insects drop or rise. 
        This provides people with information that can help us respond much faster to 
        changes. The AnimalTrack app allows users to upload different animal/insect
        photos taken, and also helping the environment by tracking the sightings of 
        each species. When users upload pictures of animals/insects to AnimalTrack, 
        a graph will be formed that displays the trend of the uploaded species each year. 
        For example, if someone sees a squirrel in their backyard, they would press the 
        camera button and take a photo of it. After that, a screen will show up that displays
        what type of species it is through the AI identifier, information about that animal 
        such as diet and habitat, and any comments that the uploader wants to tell other users 
        when they look at their post. When they post the image, a thumbnail will show up on the 
        home page, displaying a map of their community and the image taken. The purpose of 
        AnimalTrack is that animal/insect/environment organizations can determine the reasons 
        behind the rise and fall of each species and also excelerating the speed in which they
        find out when a species decreases or increases, and reacting much quicker when changes
        occur. AnimalTrack is helping to protect these organisms by getting people's attention
        towards protecting the animals and insects. When more and more people join, the data
        formed will be more accurate.
